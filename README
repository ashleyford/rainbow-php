My attempt at a quick way in php to write a MVC-esque site.  I need to really 
write a meta programming script that'll autogenerate this code. So far all 
I've done is create a way to make clean controllers/urls.  I'm not entirely 
content with it so it'll probably change in the upcomming weeks.

             If you have feature requests please send email.
